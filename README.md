## IMPROVEMENTS

1. I am implementing a subscription model for this desktop application, similar to those used by Netflix and Amazon Prime, to enhance user experience.


2. I am currently working on a security patch for this application to ensure its safety and reliability.


3. In order to make the application more accessible to users, I am developing a website to complement the desktop version.
